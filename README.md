# Regression_ML

## Overview
This repository contains code for implementing regression algorithms in machine learning. Regression is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict continuous target variables based on input features. This README provides an overview of regression, common regression algorithms, and instructions for usage.

## Algorithms
Several regression algorithms are commonly used in machine learning, including:

1. *Linear Regression*: A linear model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. It is often used for simple regression tasks with one or more input features.

2. *Ridge Regression*: A linear regression model with L2 regularization, which penalizes large coefficient values to prevent overfitting.

3. *Lasso Regression*: A linear regression model with L1 regularization, which promotes sparsity in the coefficient values by penalizing some coefficients to exactly zero.

4. *ElasticNet Regression*: A linear regression model that combines L1 and L2 regularization to achieve a balance between Ridge and Lasso regression.

5. *Decision Tree Regression*: A non-linear regression model that recursively partitions the feature space into subsets and fits a simple model (e.g., a constant) within each subset.

6. *Random Forest Regression*: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees as the final prediction.

7. *Gradient Boosting Regression*: A boosting technique that builds an ensemble of weak regression models (typically decision trees) sequentially, each correcting the errors of its predecessor.

8. *Support Vector Regression (SVR)*: A regression algorithm based on support vector machines, which finds the hyperplane that best fits the data with a specified margin.

## Usage
To utilize regression algorithms in your machine learning projects, follow these steps:

1. *Install Dependencies*: Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

2. *Load Data*: Load the dataset into memory using appropriate libraries such as Pandas for tabular data or NumPy for numerical arrays.

3. *Preprocess Data*: Preprocess the data as necessary, including handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

4. *Choose Algorithm*: Select the regression algorithm(s) suitable for your dataset and problem domain. Consider factors such as linearity of the relationship, interpretability, and performance.

5. *Train Model*: Train the chosen algorithm(s) on the training data using appropriate hyperparameters. Use techniques like cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

6. *Evaluate Model*: Evaluate the trained model(s) on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or R-squared.

7. *Fine-tuning*: Optionally, fine-tune hyperparameters or explore different feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
